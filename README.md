# KS1998

The repository solves the Krusell and Smith, 1998 JPE economy with a perceived law of motion for the capital stock in the version with exogenous labor supply. The code is inspired by the Python code of Joao B. Duarte (available at https://github.com/jbduarte/Computational-Methods-in-Macro/blob/master/5-%20Incomplete%20Markets%20%2B%20Aggregate%20Uncertainty%20Models/Krusell_Smith.ipynb), but optimized for Julia.

I am currently working on code solving the Krusell and Smith, 1997 Macroeconomic Dynamics asset pricing version of this model, as well.
